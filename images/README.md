## Everything you'll ever need.

In this lab we utilized loops and provided photo assets to make a randomized display of images on a web page. Users then are encouraged to engage with these images by clicking them. The clicks count as votes that are filtered through calculations and into a series of Chart.js charts. We then access local storage on the user's machine to store results over successive voting sessions in order to gather a more substantial dataset. We styled and branded the page and the charts with CSS and populated a list with statistics before feeding the charts.
