### A catalog of the future--the next wave--a new generation of sales and marketing opportunities for the world's pleasure!

Bus Mall is the future of shopping for public commuters! The home page filters through 3 random images from a selection of 20. *While* loops and *or* operators populate the 3 front images with "random" non-repeated images. A series of counters records "veiws" and "clicks" and output these numbers into a bar graph built on the chart.js library. Another counter compares the percentage of clicks to views and renders this information in a donut graph. These results are also displayed as strings in a list using template literals.  

Then, I established a link with device local storage to store the results of a user's votes over the course of multiple sessions. The program access JSON to stringfy user inputs upon storage, then recovers the information and parses is out into the same data type which it had been stored as. The window or browser can be closed and vote results still recovered--an amazing capability of modern web applications. A little dyanimc styling with CSS and JavaScript, and a couple custom fonts from Google Fonts finish the project!

Have fun, click away, and look forward to these products hitting busses near you!
